# FISH Barcode Architecture Modelling
Author: Camillo Moschner

Purpose: Fluorescent *In Situ* Hybridisation (FISH) is a well-tested molecular biology technique. However, many different methods have been used to generate specific *readout sequences*. 
Here, I 
1. summarise 3 barcode architectures previously used for FISH readout sequences,
2. invent a novel, 4th barcode architecture I term "power set-enabled factorial" design,
3. generate mathematical formulations for the behaviour of each architecture, and finally
4. identify the optimal barcode architecture through computational modelling.
